Below is the list of some major courses I had taken in HYU.  

- Algorithm (A)
- Digital Image Processing (A+)
- Artificial Intelligence (A)
- Data Structure (A+)
- Operating Systems (A)
- Computer Networks (A)
- Linear Algebra (A+)
- Computer Graphics 
- Database
- Digital Signal Processing (A)
- Electronic Circuits Design (A)
- Embedded Systems

Some of these courses required term-projects. Followings are the brief introductions of the projects and the capstone project for graduation.

#### 3D Model Reconstruction with a Monocular Camera (incomplete)
<p class="post-annotation">Capstone project, 2011. Advisor â€“ Prof. Jong-il Park <br />
with Huiseong Sinn</p>

This attempt was trying to construct a 3D model of the object in real-space with a cheap webcam. Although we succeeded to find and match feature points in right places of the 3D model, unfortunately could not achieve the original goal. 

- Marker detection, feature extraction(SURF) and matching (FLANN) 
- C++ and OpenCV

#### 3D Reversi
<p class="post-annotation">Term project for Computer Graphics / Computer Networks classes. Fall 2010</p>

This project is well-known Reversi game made with 3D-graphics. This also supports multi-play features (game-playing and chatting).

- C++, OpenGL and MFC/WPF (for UI and sockets)
