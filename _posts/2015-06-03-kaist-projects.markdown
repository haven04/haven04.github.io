The Air-Q clip is a prototype of a wearable device, which is a *"PM2.5 dust-sensor clip that monitors the quality of the air you breathe."* This prototype device is designed to look the same as an usual hairpin, except that it has a feature which allows users to monitor the air quality instantly. By only clicking a button, it shows the amount of fine particles (smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) in the atmosphere through LED indicators.

- Designed the circuit and software
- LilyPad Arduino and Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F (dust sensor) were used

###Standardization of Recording Techniques for Korean Traditional Instruments
<p class="post-annotation">Government-led project; 2012-2014<br />AIM Lab, KAIST</p>

This project was led by Korea Creative Content Agency (Kocca). The goal of this project is to find the optimal recording techniques for Korean traditional musical instruments.

For the project, I researched various recording methods generally used in the industry and applied those methods to record sound of the instruments in different environments. Through experiments and sound spectrum analysis, the most optimal recording methods depending on the environments were suggested.
