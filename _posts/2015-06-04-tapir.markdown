"TAPIR Sound Tag" is a software framework that allows users to communicate data signals through "Theoretically Audible, but Practically Inaudible Range" (TAPIR) of sound. This can be used for developing various applications.

### TAPIR Sound Tag

"TAPIR Sound Tag" is the patent-pending technology (in South Korea), which allows modern mobile devices to communicate digital data using specific frequency range of sound above human-auditory range.

Using sound as a medium of data transmission has some advantages. With sound, a large broadcasting network like a TV network can be built instantly without expensive equipments, but only loudspeakers. Moreover, it does not occupy network bandwidth for communication. These properties can be attractive especially in certain facilities with well equipped sound systems such as stadiums or concert halls, where a large amount people are located and local data network often cannot afford all data traffics. With this system, it is allowed to send some information to every user's mobile devices.

### Technical Details

It employed techniques widely used in modern communication systems such as OFDM, which is already applied for LTE and DTV. Therefore, faster transmission speed and high-robustness against noise comparing to other similar approaches are achieved. Powered by own-developed software DSP modules and underlying SIMD(NEON) instructions, the devices can send 25 Bytes of data under 860Hz of audio bandwidth in a second. It means that 8 bytes of (shorten) URL can be transmitted to other devices before 0.3 seconds. 

Since the "TAPIR Sound Tag" framework offers well-designed software API based on C++. Application developers for mobile platforms (iOS/Android) can easily adopt their idea to the mobile applications without advanced knowledge in signal processing or audio engineering.

### TAPIR Guide - Location-aware Mobile Guide System

As described, "TAPIR Sound Tag" can be applied for various fields. Especially, it allows to build a location based-service with low cost and cheap equipments (loudspeakers and audio players). The one of representative applications of the system is a location-based guide system for exhibition space, namely "TAPIR Guide".

The idea was first suggested in the conference "Museum and the Web 2013". In February and April in 2014, the mobile applications using TAPIR Sound Tag framework were released for two major museums in Korea (*Lee Ungno Museum* in Daejeon) and France (*Petit Palais* in Paris), in cooperations with museum associations (*Goam Art & Culture Foundation* and *Paris Musées*) and mobile applications companies (*YZ interactive* and [*smartApps*](http://smartapps.fr/)). Below videos introduce how these apps work.
